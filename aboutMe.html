                <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
                <p>Hi! My name is <span id="name">Rachel</span>. I'm an analytical and detail-oriented accountant with a background in data analytics. While I lack extensive experience, I make up for it with my coachability and a passion for continuous learning. I am seeking opportunities for professional growth where I can apply my skills and learn from industry leaders.</p><br>
                <p>When I'm not practicing coding, I enjoy playing strategy games and creating mods for The Sims 4. These hobbies have enhanced my problem-solving skills and creativity, allowing me to approach challenges with a unique perspective. Additionally, I often spend time with my nephews and nieces when I can. I've been babysitting and an aunt since I was 10, which has taught me patience, responsibility, and the importance of family. Music is an essential part of my life, providing inspiration and relaxation. I also have a deep love for animals and believe in the importance of integrity in all aspects of life.</p><br>
